        <h1>About MeðŸ˜Ž</h1>
        <p>As a dedicated student at SRM Institute of Science and Technology, I'm driven by a strong curiosity for computer science and a commitment to excellence. My academic journey is marked by a consistent record of high achievement, and I currently hold a CGPA of 9.31, reflecting my disciplined approach to learning and problem-solving.</p>
        <p>My passion for leadership extends beyond the classroom. I currently have the honor of serving as the Chair for our university's prestigious ACM SIGMOBILE chapter, where I guide a talented team in fostering a community of innovation through technical workshops and events. This role is the culmination of years of experience, building on a foundation set in school where I had the privilege of leading the swimming and march-past teams and serving on the school council.</p>
        <p>I am passionate about applying my skills to solve real-world problems. This drive led me to a valuable virtual internship with Samsung PRISM from January to August 2024, where I had the opportunity to contribute to cutting-edge projects. Beyond formal internships, I believe the best way to master a skill is by doing, which is why I dedicate my time to building personal applications. This very portfolio is a product of that philosophyâ€”a hands-on example of my ability to create clean, functional, and visually engaging digital experiences.</p>
